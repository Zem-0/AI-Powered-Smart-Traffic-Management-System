The model dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic density and predicted congestion patterns.       Additionally, an LSTM model is implemented to predict future traffic flow based on historical data. This predictive capability allows the system to anticipate congestion and adjust signal timings proactively, improving overall traffic management.")

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an object detection algorithm capable of identifying and classifying multiple vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles, in a single frame. The detected vehicles are assigned bounding boxes, which provide precise locations of each vehicle within the frame.")

This data is stored in a structured format, allowing for real-time monitoring of vehicle density. The traffic data is then analyzed to determine congestion levels and traffic flow patterns.")
    
    st.subheader("3. Dynamic Traffic Signal Adjustment")
    st.write("Using the collected vehicle data, an AI-based algorithm calculates the optimal duration for the green light. The more congested a lane is, the longer the green light remains active to allow traffic to pass efficiently. The system ensures that each direction receives an appropriate amount of time, preventing unnecessary delays and reducing idle vehicle time at intersections.")

    st.write("The AI model continuously learns from historical traffic patterns using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). This allows the system to predict future congestion levels and adjust signal timings accordingly. Multiple simulations are run to fine-tune the model and optimize performance over time.")
