# 🚦 AI-Powered Traffic Signal Simulation

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed timers, leading to inefficiencies such as unnecessary waiting times and congestion. This project aims to develop an **AI-powered adaptive traffic management system** that dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions detected using YOLOv8.  

---

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**  
This project consists of three main modules:  

### **1️⃣ Vehicle Detection Module**  
- Uses **YOLOv8** to detect vehicles in live traffic feeds.  
- Classifies detected vehicles into **cars, bikes, buses, trucks, and rickshaws**.  

### **2️⃣ Signal Switching Algorithm**  
- Dynamically adjusts **red, yellow, and green signal durations**.  
- Takes into account:  
  ✅ **Vehicle count per lane**  
  ✅ **Vehicle type (car, bus, etc.)**  
  ✅ **Average vehicle speed**  

### **3️⃣ Simulation Module**  
- Built using **[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)** to simulate:  
  ✅ **Traffic signals**  
  ✅ **Vehicle movements**  
  ✅ **Signal timing adjustments**  

For more details on the **object detection model**, **algorithm**, and **simulation**, refer to the documentation.

## 🚀 **Features**  
✅ **YOLOv8-Based Vehicle Detection** – Detects vehicles from real-time traffic video feeds.  
✅ **LSTM-Based Traffic Prediction** – Forecasts future congestion trends.  
✅ **Automated Traffic Signal Control** – Adjusts green light durations dynamically.  
✅ **Multiple Simulation Runs** – Runs the simulation multiple times and saves data.  
✅ **Excel Report Output** – Stores final traffic analysis results.

## 🛠 **How It Works**  
1. **Vehicle Detection:** YOLOv8 detects vehicles from live video feeds.

2. **Traffic Data Processing:** The detected vehicle counts are analyzed.  
3. **Signal Adjustment:** Green light durations are set based on vehicle density.  
4. **Prediction with LSTM:** Future congestion trends are forecasted.  
5. **Simulation Execution:** The model is tested through multiple runs.  
6. **Result Storage:** Data is saved in an **Excel sheet** for further analysis.
